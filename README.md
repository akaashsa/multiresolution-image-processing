# Multiresolution Image Processing (Gaussian, Laplacian Pyramids, Wavelets)

## Project Overview
Implemented multiresolution analysis techniques to process and reconstruct images at different scales. Techniques included Gaussian pyramids, Laplacian pyramids, and wavelet decomposition.

## Key Methods
- Gaussian Pyramid creation and expansion
- Laplacian Pyramid decomposition and reconstruction
- Haar Wavelet decomposition using PyWavelets
- Applications: Image compression, blending, denoising

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- PyWavelets

## Results
- Demonstrated image reconstruction fidelity across scales
- Visualized wavelet components and compression trade-offs

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies (`pip install opencv-python pywavelets numpy`)
2. Run `multiresolution_analysis.py`
3. Check outputs in `/outputs` folder
